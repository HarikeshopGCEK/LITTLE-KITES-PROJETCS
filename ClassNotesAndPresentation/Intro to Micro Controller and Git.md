# Lets Jump From Arduino Shall we ?

-----

1. **I know for a Fact that you guys are pros at these things . But lets take a jump We can move forward from Arduino and explore some Very nice new friends
2. **** As we are dealing with IoT someone like Arduino who comes without and Internet connection is a draw back
3. **** Lets put him on a side and Explore a New Board Called NodeMCU
4. ![[pngegg.png]]
5. As beautiful as he looks as powerful he is. [[NOdeMCU|Lets go and learn a bit about him]]
