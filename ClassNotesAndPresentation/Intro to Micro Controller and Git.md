1. **I know for a Fact that you guys are pros at these things . But lets take a jump We can move forward from Arduino and explore some Very nice new friends
2. **** As we are dealing with IoT someone like Arduino who comes without and Internet connection is a draw back
3. **** Lets put him on a side and Explore a New Board Called NodeMCU

## How do we program it
1. You guys may be familiarised with Arduino IDE
2. But we gotta be able to program NodeMCU With it
3. Lets setup the Arduino IDE
### Setting Up the IDE
1. Arduino IDE May be already installed now we got to tweak it a bit
2. Open File -> Prerences -> Scroll Down to Addiotional Board Manager Url
3. Paste the following url in the box   `http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json`
4. Now when uploading the code make sure you select the following board

## Why Choose C/C++ for NodeMCU (ECE POV)

### üîß 1. **Precise Hardware Control**

- C lets you control **GPIO**, **timers**, **interrupts**, and **PWM** with **pin-level precision**.
    
- MicroPython is **not real-time friendly** ‚Äî delays and jitter can mess up sensor timing or communication.
    

üó£Ô∏è "You don‚Äôt want your ultrasonic sensor missing a pulse because Python was busy sipping chai ‚òï."

---

### üß† 2. **More RAM & Flash for You**

- MicroPython interpreter **eats up flash and RAM**
    
- In ESP8266 (with 4MB flash and ~50KB RAM), MicroPython uses ~1MB+ itself.
    
- C gives you **more room for your code and data**.
    

---

### üì° 3. **Tighter Wi-Fi & Networking Control**

- ESP8266‚Äôs Wi-Fi and TCP/IP stack is **better supported in C (Arduino libraries)**.
    
- You can write **asynchronous web servers**, do OTA updates, and use **MQTT** efficiently in C.
    

---

### üß™ 4. **ECE Experiments Need Speed**

- For things like:
    
    - Measuring pulses from a tachometer
        
    - Generating waveforms
        
    - Controlling motors with PWM
        
    - Reading analog sensors with high precision  
        C is simply more **reliable** and **real-time**.

# What is Git & GitHub

---
- **** Git is basically a time machine for your projects
	- It knows what you have done so far
	- Knows what changes you made to them
	- You can go back in time and access anything from past
- ********** Basic Functions Of Git 
	- Commit - Saving project in each point of time
	- Branch new path to try changes without effecting the main project
	- Merge : combine your experiment with og project
- **** GitHub is an online show case where the projects are saved and showcased
