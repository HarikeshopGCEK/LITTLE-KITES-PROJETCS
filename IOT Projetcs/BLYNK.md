# USING THE BLYNK IOT CLOUD PLATFORM FOR A SIMPLE IOT PROJECT

## Introduction

Blynk is a popular platform for building IoT applications. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing devices, visualizing data, and creating automation workflows. In this guide, we will walk through the steps to integrate Blynk into a simple IoT project using the ESP8266 microcontroller.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Arduino programming
- An ESP8266 microcontroller (e.g., NodeMCU, Wemos D1 Mini)
- A Blynk account (you can create one for free at https://blynk.io/)
- Blynk app installed on your smartphone (available for iOS and Android)

## Step 1: Set Up Blynk Template

1. Log in to your Blynk account and navigate to the "Templates" section.
2. Create a new template and give it a name (e.g., "ESP8266 IoT Project").
3. Note the **Template ID** and **Device Name**; you will need these later.
4. Add a new device to the template and select the ESP8266 as the device type
5. Go to the "Data Streams" section and create a new data stream for the temperature and humidity readings. Set the data type to "Float" for temperature and "Integer" for humidity.
6. Save the template.
7. Go to webdashboard and create a new dashboard for your template.
8. Add widgets for displaying temperature and humidity data. You can use a gauge widget for temperature and a value display widget for humidity.
9. Configure the widgets to read from the data streams you created earlier.
10. Save the dashboard.

## Step 2: Install Blynk Library

1. Open the Arduino IDE and go to **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries**.
2. Search for "Blynk" and install the latest version of the Blynk library.
3. Also, install the "ESP8266WiFi" library if it's not already installed.
4. If you are using a DHT sensor, install the "DHT Sensor Library" by Adafruit.
5. If you are using a BME280 sensor, install the "Adafruit BME280 Library" and "Adafruit Unified Sensor" libraries.
6. If you are using a BMP280 sensor, install the "Adafruit BMP280 Library" and "Adafruit Unified Sensor" libraries.

## Step 3: Write the Arduino Code

1. Go to examples and open the Blynk example for ESP8266.
2. Replace the template ID and device name with the ones you created earlier.
3. Add the necessary libraries for your sensors (DHT, BME280, or BMP280).
4. Write the code to read data from the sensors and send it to Blynk.
5. Here is a sample code snippet for reading temperature and humidity from a DHT sensor:

## Step 4: Connecting to internet

1. Open the Blynk app on your smartphone.
2. Go to the "Devices" section and select the device you created earlier.
3. Click on the "Connect" button to establish a connection between your ESP8266 and the Blynk cloud.
4. Once connected, you should see the temperature and humidity readings on your dashboard.
